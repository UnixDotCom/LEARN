 CreateStack: Starts the creation of a new stack. The input parameters to the call include the stack name and a file name (or Amazon S3 URL) for the source template. If the process of creating the stack is completed successfully, the stack is in the CREATE_COMPLETE state. If the stack creation fails, AWS CloudFormation deletes previously created resources, unless the user specified a flag to retain these elements for debugging purposes.
